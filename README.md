# Private Events Web App

The main objective of this project was to build an events application such as `EventBrite`. This was supposed to demonstrate a mastery in working with `Rails Associations`. Here, a User can be both a creator and attendee of an event and an Event has many attendees. To accomplish this `many-to-many` relationship, we had to create an inner join table called `attendance`.
